Question: Decompose a positive integer into prime factors. Example: Enter 90, print 90 = 2*3*3*5.


Thinking:To factorize n, you should first find the smallest prime number, k, and then complete the following steps.

(1) If this prime number is exactly equal to n, then the process of decomposing prime factors is complete and can be printed out.

(2) If n <> k, but n is divisible by k, print out the value of k and divide n by k as the quotient of the new positive integer you n, repeating the first step.

(3) If n is not divisible by k, then use k+1 as the value of k and repeat the first step.
